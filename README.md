### Description 
The Team Profile Generator is a node application that generates an html page of the user's team that they have created through the node inquirer prompts.  The html page consists of cards for each team member, with information relevant to that team member, and a link to their email address.  Here is a link to a video showcasing the application: [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsPUYsLd_zU)
